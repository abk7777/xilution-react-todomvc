## FAQ

1. üí∞ How much does it cost to run this example?
	* [AWS offers a "free" tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) which enables you to gain free, hands-on experience with the AWS platform, products and services.
	* You may find the [AWS Simple Monthly Calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to be useful in calculating your monthly AWS expense as well.
	* Pricing for AWS Managed Service's used in this example
		* [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)
			* Highlight: The first 1 million requests per month are free for all subscribers! üéâ
		* [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/)
		* [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)
		* [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/)
		* [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing/)
		* For comparison, here is AWS's published pricing for virtual server and managed server services.
			* [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)
			* [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/pricing/)

1. Why React?
	* React was chosen for this example's frontend because of its pervasiveness and (most importantly) its [unit testability](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html).

1. Is the backend necessary?
	* The purpose of the backend is two fold.
      First, it abstracts domain specific functionality from the frontend.
      For example, some TodoMVC uses cases require the aggregation of a few different Xilution SaaS requests.
      Second, it protects secrets like the Xilution Subscriber API Key and the Xilution Subscriber Organization ID.

1. Can this example run on other public cloud platforms?
	* In theory, yes.
	  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) offer similar types of web hosting and compute services needed to run this example.
	  Eventually, I would like to develop [Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/) templates for several different public cloud platforms.
	  If you're passionate about your cloud platform and would like to see it incorporated in this example, I invite you to submit a pull request.

1. What about the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework?
	* I personally don't have experience working with the Serverless framework, but I hear good things.
	  The pervasiveness of the framework warrants a mention in this example's FAQ.
	  I [applaud the maintainers of the framework](https://serverless.com/company/team/) for their advancement of serverless computing.
	  I would like to learn more about the framework and how it could be incorporated into this example.
	  If you're passionate about the Serverless framework or other similar frameworks, I invite you to submit a pull request.
